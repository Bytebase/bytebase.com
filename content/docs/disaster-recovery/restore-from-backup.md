title: Restore from Backup
---

<HintBlock type="info">

User who is the member of the project owning the database, as well as the Workspace Admin and DBA can restore backup.

</HintBlock>

Bytebase allows to restore backup to a new database under the same project and environment. When Bytebase restores the backup to a new database, it also records the original parent database as well as a branch migration history linking with the restoring process.

## Step 1 - Choose the backup to be restored

## Step 2 - Choose the new database name for the restore

For now, Bytebase only allows to restore to a new database under the same project and environment as the original database producing the backup.

## Step 3 - Execute restore workflow

Bytebase will create a 2-stage issue for the restore workflow. The 1st stage is to create the new database, followed by restoring the backup to that database. For `Workspace Admin or DBA`, the workflow will start automatically. For `Developer`, the workflow requires `Workspace Admin or DBA` approval first.

## Step 4 - View the restored database

For a successfully restored database, Bytebase records the parent database it's restored from. It also records a `Branch` migration history showing the issue detailing the restoring process.
