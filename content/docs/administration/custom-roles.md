In **Settings > Custom Roles**, you can define new custom roles and apply them to project members.

Custom roles don't bear any additional permissions in the project. They are used in the [custom approval](/docs/administration/custom-approval). e.g. If you want to add `tester` to the approval flow, you can define a `tester` custom role and
add it to the custom approval flow. Then in the project, you can grant that `tester` custom role to the project's
assigned testers.

## Create custom roles

To create custom roles, go to **Settings > Custom Roles**. Click **Add role** to create a new role.
