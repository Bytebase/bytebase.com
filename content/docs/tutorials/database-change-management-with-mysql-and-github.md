## Overview

In the last article [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with MySQL](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-mysql), you have tried **UI workflow** in Bytebase.

This tutorial will bring your MySQL schema change to the next level by introducing the **GitOps workflow**, where you commit the schema change script to the GitHub repository, which will in turn trigger the schema deployment pipeline in Bytebase.

You can use Bytebase's **Community Plan** to finish the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure you have the following ready:

- Finished our previous UI-based change tutorial [Database CI/CD and Schema Migration with MySQL](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-mysql).
- A local MySQL server.
- A GitHub account and a public GitHub repository, e.g. `test-bb-gitops`.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed locally.
- An [ngrok](http://ngrok.com/) account.

## Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

## Step 2 - Find your MySQL in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase Console through the browser via your ngrok URL. Log in using your admin account.

1. Create one or two new databases on your Spanner instances for different environments, refer to [previous tutorial](/docs/tutorials/database-change-management-with-mysql) if you need help.
