Database change is a tricky part of the application development process: it usually involves multiple databases from different environments and cross-team collaboration, to add on top of it, databases are touch and go. It got us thinking: **can we treat database the same way we treat application code?**

DORA (DevOps Research & Assessment) [pointed out](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-database-change-management) that integrating database work into the software delivery process positively contributes to continuous delivery. Itâ€™s about time to make databases a part of the CI/CD cycle.

But how does it work, really?

## A Complete Database CI/CD Workflow

Here, we present **a complete Database CI/CD workflow with Bitbucket**. It's similar with GitLab, GitHub or Azure DevOps.

![database-devops-workflow-bitbucket](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/database-devops-workflow-bitbucket.webp)

1. The developer creates a Merge Request containing the SQL migration script;
2. The team leader or another peer on the dev teams approves the change and merges the SQL script into a branch;
3. The merge event automatically triggers the release pipeline in Bytebase and creates a release ticket capturing the intended change;
4. (Optional) an approval flow will be auto matched based on the change risk and be followed via Bytebaseâ€™s built-in UI;
5. Approved scripts are executed gradually according to the configured rollout stages;
6. The latest database schema is automatically written back to the code repository after applying changes. With this, the Dev team always has a copy of the latest schema. Furthermore, they can configure downstream pipelines based on the change of that latest schema;
7. Confirm the migration and proceed to the corresponding application rollout.

## Set Up Database CI/CD with Bitbucket in Bytebase (Free Plan)

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up this Database CI/CD with Bitbucket in Bytebase.

## Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/vcs-with-ngrok"></IncludeBlock>

### Step 2 - Add Bitbucket.org as a Git provider in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase via your ngrok URL. Click **gear icon** (Settings) > **Integration** > **GitOps**, choose `Bitbucket.org`, and click **Next**. You will see STEP 2. Copy the **Redirect URI**.
   ![bb-gitops-bitbucket](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-gitops-bitbucket.webp)

2. Go to `https://bitbucket.org/`, your account must be an workspace admin of the Bitbucket workspace (able to access the workspace Settings page). Go to the **Settings** page, then navigate to **APPS AND FEATURES** > **OAuth consumers** section and click **Add a consumer**. Fill in the following fields:

   - **Name**: `Bytebase`
   - **Redirect URI**: Copied from Bytebase GitOps config STEP 2
   - **Permissions**: `Account > Read`, `Webhooks > Read and write`, `Repositories > Write`

   Click **Save**.

   ![bib-add-oauth](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bib-add-oauth.webp)

3. Copy the **Key** and **Secret** from the Bitbucket and paste them into the Bytebase GitOps config page. Click **Next**. Click **Authorize** on popup. You will be redirected to the confirmation page. Click **Confirm and add**, and the Git provider is successfully added.

   ![bb-gitops-done](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-gitops-done.webp)

### Step 3 - Configure a GitOps Workflow in Bytebase

1. Go to `bitbucket.org` and create a new project `bb-gitops-ngrok`. 

2. Go to Bytebase, go to the `Sample Project`. Click **GitOps** tab and choose `GitOps workflow`. Click **Configure GitOps**. Choose `Bitbucket.org` (the git provider you just configured) and the repository you just created.

   ![bb-proj-gitops-repo](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-proj-gitops-repo.webp)

3. You'll be redirected to STEP 3. Change **Branch** to `master`, keep everything else as default, and click **Finish**.

   ![bb-proj-gitops-branch](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-proj-gitops-branch.webp)


### Step 4 - Create a Pull Request to trigger issue creation

1. Go to `bb-gitops-ngrok` on Bitbucket. Create a new branch `add-nickname-table-employee`. On the new branch, create a subdirectory `bytebase`, and create a sub-subdirectory `prod`. Within the `prod` directory, create a file `employee##202311012500##ddl##add_nickname_table_employee.sql`. Copy the following SQL script into the file and commit the change.
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "nick_name" text;
   ```
2. Create a pull request including the above commits and merge it. Go back to Bytebase, you'll see there is a new issue created by the pull request.

   ![bb-proj-activity-push-event](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-proj-activity-push-event.webp)

3. Click the issue to see the details. SQL review automatic checks failed. Click the warning, you'll see the details.

   ![bb-issue-sql-review-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-issue-sql-review-warning.webp)

   ![bb-issue-sql-review-not-null-warning](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-issue-sql-review-not-null-warning.webp)

4. Go to **Environments**, you'll see there's a SQL Review policy attached with `Prod`. Click **Edit**, you'll see three activated SQL Review rules.

   ![bb-sql-policy](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-sql-policy.webp)


5. Update the SQL script and commit in a new branch and click **Merge**.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "nick_name" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

6. Go back to Bytebase, and refresh the issue. You'll see the SQL review passed. Because there is no approval flow or manual rollout configured. The issue rollouts automatically. You may click **View change** to see the diff.

## Advanced Features (Enterprise Plan)

You may upgrade to Enterprise plan to explore more features.

Click **Start free trial** on the left bottom and upgrade to Enterprise plan,
Go to **Instances** to **Assign License** for the existing two instances.

### Manual Rollout

Go to **Environments** > **2.Prod**, Find **Rollout policy** section, and choose **Manual rollout** > **Require rolling out by dedicated roles**.

    ![bb-env-prod-manual-rollout](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-env-prod-manual-rollout.webp)

### Custom Approval

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security & Policy** > **Custom Approval**. Set `Project Owner -> DBA` as Approval flow for **DDL** > **High Risk**.

   ![bb-custom-approval](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-custom-approval.webp)

2. Go to **Settings** > **Security & Policy** > **Risk Center**. Click **Add rule** and click **Load** for the first template. Click **Add**.

   ![bb-risk-center-ddl-high](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-risk-center-ddl-high.webp)

### LATEST Schema Write-back

After schema migration completes, Bytebase will write the latest schema back to the Git repository. So that
the team always has a canonical source of truth for the database schema in Git.

1. Go back to Bitbucket, and create a new branch `add-country-table-employee`. Create a file `employee##202311011700##ddl##add_country_table_employee.sql` under `bytebase/prod` directory. Copy the following SQL script into the file and commit the change.
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "country" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```
2. Go back to Bytebase, and go to the newly created issue. Because of the settings we made above, it matches the approval flow `Project Owner -> DBA`,

3. After following the approval flow to click **Approve**, the banner will show **Waiting for Rollout** instead. The **Assignee** then can click **Rollout**.

4. Go back to Bitbucket, you'll notice there's a new file `.employee##LATEST.sql` under `bytebase/prod/` with the latest schema written back by Bytebase.

### Schema Drift

Bytebase has built-in [schema drift detection](/docs/change-database/drift-detection/) to detect unexpected schema changes. Let's use the [SQL Editor Admin Mode](/docs/sql-editor/admin-mode/) to simulate this.

1. Click **terminal icon** (SQL Editor) on the top right. You'll be redirected to **SQL Editor**. Click **Admin mode**. Everything you do in this mode is the same as connecting directly to the server, which is not recorded by Bytebase.

2. Select `(Prod) employee` on the left, and paste and run the following script:

   ```sql
       ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
       ADD COLUMN "city" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

3. Go back to Bytebase Console, and click **Databases** > `employee` under `Prod`. Click **Sync Now**. After seeing the success message, refresh the page. You'll see the schema drift. You may configure auto scan on instance detail page to avoid manual sync.

   ![bb-db-schema-drift](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-bitbucket/bb-db-schema-drift.webp)

4. Go to **Anomaly Center**, and you'll see the Schema drift there too.

## Summary

Now with Bytebase, you have a complete Database CI/CD workflow with Bitbucket. You can apply this workflow to your own project and customize it to fit your needs. If you have any questions, please feel free join and discuss in [Discord](https://discord.gg/huyw7gRsyA).
