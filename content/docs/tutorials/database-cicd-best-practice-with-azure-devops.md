Database change is a tricky part of the application development process: it usually involves multiple databases from different environments and cross-team collaboration, to add on top of it, databases are touch and go. It got us thinking: **can we treat database the same way we treat application code?**

DORA (DevOps Research & Assessment) [pointed out](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-database-change-management) that integrating database work into the software delivery process positively contributes to continuous delivery. Itâ€™s about time to make databases a part of the CI/CD cycle.

But how does it work, really?

## A Complete Database CI/CD Workflow

Here, we present **a complete Database CI/CD workflow with Azure DevOps**. It's similar with GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab.

1. The developer creates a Pull Request containing the SQL migration script;
2. SQL Review CI is automatically triggered to review SQL and offers suggestions to assist the code review;
3. After several possible iterations, the team leader or another peer on the dev teams approves the change and merges the SQL script into a branch;
4. The merge event automatically triggers the release pipeline in Bytebase and creates a release ticket capturing the intended change;
5. (Optional) an approval flow will be auto matched based on the change risk and be followed via Bytebaseâ€™s built-in UI;
6. Approved scripts are executed gradually according to the configured rollout stages;
7. The latest database schema is automatically written back to the code repository after applying changes. With this, the Dev team always has a copy of the latest schema. Furthermore, they can configure downstream pipelines based on the change of that latest schema;
8. Confirm the migration and proceed to the corresponding application rollout.

## Set Up Database CI/CD with Azure DevOps in Bytebase (Free Plan)

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up this Database CI/CD with Azure DevOps in Bytebase.

## Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/vcs-with-ngrok"></IncludeBlock>

## Step 2 - Add Azure DevOps as a Git provider in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase via your ngrok URL. Click **gear icon** (Settings) > **Integration** > **GitOps**, choose `Azure DevOps Service`, and click **Next**.
   ![bb-git-provider](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-git-provider.webp)

2. You will see STEP 2. Copy the **Redirect URI**. Click `Direct Link` to your Azure DevOps account.
   ![bb-gitops-step2](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-gitops-step2.webp)

3. On the Azure DevOps application registration page, fill the form as follows:

   - **Company name**: can be other names than `bb`, as long as the organization admin can identify this application is for Bytebase later
   - **Homepage URL**: can be other URLs than `https://bytebase.com`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: **Redirect URI** copied from Bytebase STEP 2, begins with the host:port where the Bytebase console is running, and followed by /oauth/callback. This is the URI Azure DevOps uses to callback Bytebase during the OAuth flow
   - **Authorizied scopes**: Find the checkboxes for `Code (full)`, `Identity (read)`, `Project and team (read)`, `Build (read and execute)`

   Click **Register application**.

   ![az-register-application](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/az-register-application.webp)

4. Click **show**. Copy the **App ID** and **Client Secret** and paste them into the Bytebase GitOps config page. Click **Next**. Click **Authorize** on popup. You will be redirected to the confirmation page. Click **Confirm and add**, and the Git provider is successfully added.

   ![bb-gitops-added](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-gitops-added.webp)

## Step 3 - Configure a GitOps Workflow in Bytebase

1. Go to Azure DevOps and create a new project `bytebase-gitops`. Click **Create project**.

2. Go to Bytebase, go to the `Sample Project`. Click **GitOps** tab and choose `GitOps workflow`. Click **Configure GitOps**.

3. Choose `Azure DevOps` (the git provider you just configured) and the repository you just created. You'll be redirected to STEP 3. Keep everything as default, scroll down to the bottom and check `Enable SQL Review CI via Azure DevOps Pipeline`. Click **Finish**.

   ![bb-sql-review-ci-setup](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-sql-review-ci-setup.webp)

4. After SQL Review CI is automatically setup, click **Review the pull request**. You'll be redirected to Azure DevOps. Click **Complete** and you'll see the CI is automatically configured. It will be triggered later once a new pull request is created.

   ![az-sql-ci-installed](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/az-sql-ci-installed.webp)

5. Go back to Bytebase, you'll see the GitOps workflow is configured successfully.

## Step 4 - Create a Pull Request and Trigger SQL Review CI

1. Go to **Environments**, you'll see there's a SQL Review policy attached with `Prod`. Click **Edit**, you'll see three activated SQL Review rules which will be applied via CI. Let's adjust this rule to `Error` and try to break.

   ![bb-sql-review-rule-not-null-error](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-sql-review-rule-not-null-error.webp)

2. To test SQL Review CI, we'll create a pull request to change the `Prod` database schema. However, it will voliate the SQL Review policy first. Go to `bytebase-gitlabcom-demo` on Azure DevOps. Click **New branch**, name it `add-nickname-table-employee`. Click **Create branch**.
3. On the new branch, create a subdirectory `bytebase`, and create a sub-subdirectory `prod`. Within the `prod` directory, create a file `employee##202310201700##ddl##add_nickname_table_employee.sql`. Copy the following SQL script into the file and commit the change.
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "nick_name" text;
   ```
4. Create a pull request including the above commits. The SQL Review CI will run automatically and show the fail message. Click **Tests** to dig deeper.

   ![az-ci-fail](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/az-ci-fail.webp)

   ![az-ci-fail-test-detail](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/az-ci-fail-test-detail.webp)

5. Update the SQL script and commit in the current branch. The SQL Review CI will run again and show the pass message. Click **Complete** and **Complete Merge**.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "nick_name" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

   ![az-ci-pass](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/az-ci-pass.webp)

6. Go back to project `Sample Project` in Bytebase, you'll see the there's an issue created by push event.

   ![bb-proj-push-event](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-proj-push-event.webp)

7. Click to go to the issue. Because there is no approval flow or manual rollout configured. The issue rollouts automatically. You may click **View change** to see the diff.

## Advanced Features (Enterprise Plan)

You may upgrade to Enterprise plan to explore more features.

Click **Start free trial** on the left bottom and upgrade to Enterprise plan,
Go to **Instances** to **Assign License** for the existing two instances.

### Manual Rollout

Go to **Environments** > **2.Prod**, Find **Rollout policy** section, and choose **Manual rollout by fixed roles** with all items checked.

    ![bb-env-prod-manual-rollout](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-env-prod-manual-rollout.webp)

### Custom Approval

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security & Policy** > **Custom Approval**. Set `Project Owner -> DBA` as Approval flow for **DDL** > **High Risk**.

   ![bb-custom-approval](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-custom-approval.webp)

2. Go to **Settings** > **Security & Policy** > **Risk Center**. Click **Add rule** and click **Load** for the first template. Click **Add**.

   ![bb-risk-center-ddl-high](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-risk-center-ddl-high.webp)

### LATEST Schema Write-back

After schema migration completes, Bytebase will write the latest schema back to the Git repository. So that
the team always has a canonical source of truth for the database schema in Git.

1. Go back to Azure DevOps, and create a new branch `add-country-table-employee`. Create a file `employee##202310201700##ddl##add_country_table_employee.sql` under `bytebase/prod` directory. Copy the following SQL script into the file and commit the change.
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "country" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```
2. Go back to Bytebase, and go to the newly created issue. Because of the settings we made above, it matches the approval flow `Project Owner -> DBA`,

   ![bb-issue-waiting-for-review](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-issue-waiting-for-review.webp)

3. After following the approval flow to click **Approve**, the banner will show **Waiting for Rollout** instead. The **Assignee** then can click **Rollout**.

4. Go back to Azure DevOps, you'll notice there's a new file `.employee##LATEST.sql` under `bytebase/prod/` with the latest schema written back by Bytebase. Ensure the branch policies permit the file to be committed to main.

   ![az-prod-latest](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/az-prod-latest.webp)

### Schema Drift

Bytebase has built-in [schema drift detection](/docs/change-database/drift-detection/) to detect unexpected schema changes. Let's use the [SQL Editor Admin Mode](/docs/sql-editor/admin-mode/) to simulate this.

1. Click **terminal icon** (SQL Editor) on the top right. You'll be redirected to **SQL Editor**. Click **Admin mode**. Everything you do in this mode is the same as connecting directly to the server, which is not recorded by Bytebase.

2. Select `(Test) employee` on the left, and paste and run the following script:

   ```sql
       ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
       ADD COLUMN "city" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

3. Go back to Bytebase Console, and click **Databases** > `employee` under `Test`. Click **Sync Now**. After seeing the success message, refresh the page. You'll see the schema drift. You may configure auto scan on instance detail page to avoid manual sync.

   ![bb-db-schema-drift](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-azure-devops/bb-db-schema-drift.webp)

4. Go to **Anomaly Center**, and you'll see the schema drift there too.
