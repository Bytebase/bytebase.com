## The Database CI/CD Workflow

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/tutorials/share/database-workflow"></IncludeBlock>

## Set Up Database CI/CD with GitLab in Bytebase (Free Plan)

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up this Database CI/CD with GitLab in Bytebase.

### Step 1 - Run Bytebase in Docker and set the External URL generated by ngrok

<IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/vcs-with-ngrok"></IncludeBlock>

### Step 2 - Add GitLab.com as a Git provider in Bytebase

1. Visit Bytebase via your ngrok URL. Click **gear icon** (Settings) > **Integration** > **GitOps**, choose `GitLab.com`, and click **Next**. You will see STEP 2. Copy the **Redirect URI**.

2. Go to `https://gitlab.com/`, click your avatar and choose **Preferences** on the dropdown menu. Click **Applications** on the left bar. Click **Add new application**. Fill in the following fields:

   - **Name**: `Bytebase`
   - **Redirect URI**: Copied from Bytebase GitOps config STEP 2
   - **Confidential**: `Yes`
   - **Scope**: `api`

   Click **Save application**.

3. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the GitLab application page and paste them into the Bytebase GitOps config page. Click **Next**. Click **Authorize** on popup. You will be redirected to the confirmation page. Click **Confirm and add**, and the Git provider is successfully added.

### Step 3 - Configure a GitOps Workflow in Bytebase

1. Go to `https://gitlab.com/` and create a new project `bytebase-gitlabcom-demo`. Set the **Visibility Level** to `Public`. Click **Create project**.

2. Go to Bytebase, go to the `Sample Project`. Click **GitOps** tab and choose `GitOps workflow`. Click **Configure GitOps**.

3. Choose `GitLab.com` (the git provider you just configured) and the repository you just created. You'll be redirected to STEP 3. Keep everything as default, scroll down to the bottom and check `Enable SQL Review CI via GitLab CI`. Click **Finish**.

4. After SQL Review CI is automatically setup, click **Review the merge request**. You'll be redirected to GitLab. Click **Merge** and you'll see the CI is automatically configured. It will be triggered later once a new merge request is created.

5. Go back to Bytebase, you'll see the GitOps workflow is configured successfully.

### Step 4 - Create a Merge Request and Trigger SQL Review CI

1. Go to **Environments**, you'll see there's a SQL Review policy attached with `Prod`. Click **Edit**, you'll see three activated SQL Review rules which will be applied via CI.

   ![bb-sql-policy](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-gitlab/bb-sql-policy.webp)

2. To test SQL Review CI, we'll create a merge request to change the `Prod` database schema. However, it will voliate the SQL Review policy first. Go to `bytebase-gitlabcom-demo` on GitLab. Click **New branch**, name it `add-nickname-table-employee`. Click **Create branch**.
3. On the new branch, create a subdirectory `bytebase`, and create a sub-subdirectory `prod`. Within the `prod` directory, create a file `employee##202309262500##ddl##add_nickname_table_employee.sql`. Copy the following SQL script into the file and commit the change.
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "nick_name" text;
   ```
4. Create a merge request including the above commits. The SQL Review CI will run automatically and show the fail message. However you can still merge it regardless of the CI result.

   ![gitlab-sql-review-ci-no-null-fail](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-gitlab/gitlab-sql-review-ci-no-null-fail.webp)

5. Update the SQL script and commit in the current branch. The SQL Review CI will run again and show the pass message. Click **Merge**.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."employee"
   ADD COLUMN "nick_name" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

   ![gitlab-sql-review-ci-pass](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-gitlab/gitlab-sql-review-ci-pass.webp)

6. Go back to project `Sample Project` in Bytebase, you'll see there's an issue created by a push event.

   ![bb-push-event-notification](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-gitlab/bb-push-event-notification.webp)

   ![bb-project-activity-push-event](/content/docs/tutorials/database-cicd-best-practice-with-gitlab/bb-project-activity-push-event.webp)

7. Click `issue/102` and redirect to the issue. Because there is no approval flow or manual rollout configured. The issue rollouts automatically. You may click **View change** to see the diff.
