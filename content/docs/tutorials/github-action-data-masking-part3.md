This is Part 3 of our tutorial series on implementing automated database masking using GitHub Actions:

- Part 1: [Column masking and masking exception with GitHub Actions](/docs/tutorials/github-action-data-masking-part1)
- Part 2: [Masking Algorithm with GitHub Actions](/docs/tutorials/github-action-data-masking-part2)
- Part 3: Data Classification and Global Masking with GitHub Actions(this one)
