title: Data Export Approval Flow
---
**Project Owners** can manually add the role of data exporter to control data export permissions. In **Enterprise Plan**, users can apply for data exporter roles by submitting a request grant issue.

## Add Exporter role manually

As a **Project Owner**, you can go to the project, click **Settings**, find the **Management members** section, and manually add the role of **Project Exporter**.

Before adding the **Project Exporter** role, you need to add the **Project Querier** role first to ensure that the user has permission to query the data.

In **Free or Pro Plan**, once the **Project Exporter** role is added, the user can export the query result of the specified database in SQL Editor.
