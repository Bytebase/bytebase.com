<EnterpriseOnlyBlock />

Data Masking is a feature that allows you to mask sensitive data in the query result. It helps you to protect sensitive data from being exposed to unauthorized users.

There're three two ways of masking data in Bytebase:
1. [Column Masking](../column-masking): Mask data based on the column you set.
2. [Global Masking Rule](../global-masking-rule): Mask data based on the rules you set.

You may also want to check out [Access Unmasking data](../access-unmasked-data) to learn how to grant access to unmasked data to specific users.
