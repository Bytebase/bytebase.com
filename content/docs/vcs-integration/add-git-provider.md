title: Add Git Provider
---

Bytebase supports following Git Providers:

- GitHub.com
- GitHub Enterprise
- GitLab.com
- Self-host GitLab
- Bitbucket.org
- Azure DevOps

## Prerequisites

- You must be the **Workspace Admin** to add Git provider.
- You may also need the help of the selected Git provider admin to create the dedicated
  service user and the personal access token.

## Overview

All providers share a similar setup:

1. Create a dedicated service user.
1. Obtain the service user credential such as personal access token with the required repository permissions:
   - **Create Webhook**. Bytebase creates a webhook in the repository to observe the merge event.
   - **Read Repository**. Bytebase reads the repository migration file to get the change statements.
   - **Write Comment**. Bytebase may add a comment to the merge request.

<HintBlock type="info">

The token may have an expired date. When the token is expired, you need to update the provider with
a new token.

</HintBlock>

Follow the instructions on the Git provider setup page. Below are the screenshots showing the required
permissions/scopes.

## GitLab.com and GitLab (self-host)

You can either create:

1. A **personal** access token, and make sure it has access to the project:

1. A **project** access token, you'll need at least `Maintainer` role:

Pay attention to the **Organization** field, it has to be `All accessible organizations`, not a specific organization.
