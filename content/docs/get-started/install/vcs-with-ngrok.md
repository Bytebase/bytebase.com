title: VCS with ngrok
---

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a reverse proxy tunnel, and in our case, we need it for a public network address in order to receive webhooks from VCS. ngrok we used here is for demonstration purposes. For production use, we recommend using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).

1. Run Bytebase in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with the following command:

   <IncludeBlock url="/docs/get-started/install/terminal-docker-run"></IncludeBlock>

1. Bytebase is running successfully in Docker, and you can visit it via `localhost:5678`. Register an admin account and it will be granted the `workspace admin` role automatically.

1. Click the **gear icon (Settings)** on the top right. Click **General** under Workspace. Paste `https://b725-103-197-71-76.ap.ngrok.io` as External URL under Network section and click Update.
