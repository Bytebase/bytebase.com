For **Enterprise Plan** you may also log into Bytebase using [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/overview).

## Manage members

As a **Workspace Admin**, you can manage all members in **Menbers & Groups** under **Security & Policy** section. Add a member on the upper-right or edit member information (e.g. edit password) by clicking the pencil icon.
