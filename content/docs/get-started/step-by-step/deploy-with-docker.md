It's recommended to [run Bytebase with Docker](/docs/get-started/self-host/#docker) which is the easiest way to get you started.

Run the following command to start Bytebase on container port `8080` and map it to localhost port `5678`.

If you ran Bytebase before, you can reset all data by running this command:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.bytebase/data
```
