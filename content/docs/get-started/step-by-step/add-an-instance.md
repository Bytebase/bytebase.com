title: Add an Instance
---

`Database Instance` or simply `Instance` models after a single database instance which is usually accessed via a host:port address. A typical database instance could be your on-premises MySQL instance, an AWS RDS instance etc. Each `Database Instance` belongs to an `Environment`.

## Prerequisites

- **Workspace Admin** or **Workspace DBA** role
- Bytebase provides two embedded sample PostgreSQL instances. You may add your own or [add a local MySQL instance](/docs/tutorials/local-mysql-instance).

## Step 1 - Add instance

Click **Instances** on the top bar and click **Add Instance**.

## Step 2 - Config instance

![config-instance](/content/docs/get-started/step-by-step/add-an-instance/config-instance.webp)

1. Select an **Instance Type** on the top.
1. Enter **Instance name**
1. Select **Environment**. Note: _Environment cannot be changed once the instance has been created_.
1. Enter **Host or Socket** and **Port**.

   The screenshot assumes you run Bytebase inside Docker and try to connect to a database instance on the same host. Thus it uses `host.docker.internal`. Check out [Configure Instance Connection](/docs/get-started/instance) for the detailed configuration guide.

1. Enter connection info: **Username** and **Password**.
1. (Optional) Enter SSL connection info:
   1. Choose **None** to not use SSL connection.
   1. Choose **CA Certificate** to use SSL connection with CA certificate only.
   1. Choose **CA Certificate + Client Key + Client Certificate** to use a full SSL connection.
1. (Optional) Assign an [instance licence](/docs/administration/license).

After adding an instance, click **Sync Now**. Switch to **Databases** tab under the instance, you may see all databases on this instance.

Click **Databases** on the top bar. You may see databases belonging to the sample instances. However, if you added your instances, you may not see them. Itâ€™s because they're not belonging to any project yet. For now, you can click **View unassigned databases** to view all.
