title: Set up Environments

**Environment** models after various environments in the development pipeline such as test, staging, prod. Most of the time, there is a 1:1 mapping between **Environment** and the real environment.


## Prerequisites

- **Workspace Admin** or **Workspace DBA** role.

## View environments

In **Environments**, view two predefined environments - `Test` and `Prod`. Click **Reorder** to adjust. You can **Archive this environment** at the bottom.

## Add or Edit an environment

In **Create an Environment**, fill in Environment Name and choose a Rollout policy. **Mark as production environment** to make it appear differently from other environments.

You can also choose an existing environment to edit name, rollout policy, etc. and click **Update**.
