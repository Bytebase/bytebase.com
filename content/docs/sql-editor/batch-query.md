You can batch query many databases having the same schema:

![batch-query-setting](/content/docs/sql-editor/batch-query-setting.webp)

For each database, the query result will show up in its own tab:

![batch-query-result1](/content/docs/sql-editor/batch-query-result1.webp)

![batch-query-result2](/content/docs/sql-editor/batch-query-result2.webp)
