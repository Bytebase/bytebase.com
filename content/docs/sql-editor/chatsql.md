After configuring the OpenAI key, an OpenAI icon will appear on the SQL Editor. Clicking the icon will toggle between
the SQL and natural language mode.

## Data privacy

In order to convert your request into an SQL query, Bytebase must provide the OpenAI platform with the tables and column names of the current database schema. However, Bytebase does not transmit any data from the tables.
