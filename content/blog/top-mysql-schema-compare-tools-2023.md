Database schema compare tool enables you to identify differences in the object structure within relational databases, and synchronize your specific objects across multiple databases. It is usually used in the following scenarios:

- Merge database changes from your private branch to your team's main branch
- Maintain schema consistency across homogeneous databases
- Build a new database test environment
- Deploy database schema changes to production based on application requirements
- Troubleshoot database problems when the service is down

According to [the DB-Engines Ranking report](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_osvsc), MySQL is the top 1 open source database. In this post, we will review 5 schema compare tools for MySQL.

## [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/)

MySQL Workbench is a graphical tool for MySQL development produced by Oracle, which includes schema comparison and synchronization utilities. It enables you to compare and synchronize schema between models, databases and SQL files. These three types can be the destination, source, or both. The following figure shows the source is model and the destination is database.

In addition, MySQL Workbench allows you to create a report showing the differences in catalog between the compared objects, as the next figure shows.

It is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

## [dbForge Schema Compare for MySQL](https://www.devart.com/dbforge/mysql/schemacompare/)

dbForge Schema Compare for MySQL is a company's bestseller product for MySQL database development and management. It allows you to compare and synchronize database schema between databases and SQL files. dbForge Schema Compare for MySQL has two distinct advantages over other comparion tools:

- Diff and synchronize MySQL databases quickly and efficiently, even extra-large ones
- Automate routine tasks via CLI to schedule your comparison and synchronization tasks

It is only available on Windows.

## [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/)

Liquibase is an open source command-line tool, which helps you track, version, and deploy database changes with declarative and imperative approaches. It provides three Diff-based commands to discover the differences between databases and database snaphots: `diff`, `diff-changelog`, and `generate-changelog`. You can refer to the section of [Database inspection commands](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/home.html#database-inspection-commands) for more details. The biggest advantage of Liquibase comparision feature is allow you to integrate them into various workflows.

What's more, the feature is available in Free Plan.

## Summing it up

If you are used to working with command line tools, Liquibase and Flyway are excellent choices. If you prefer the fine-grained control during the synchronization process, there are solutions like MySQL Workbench and dbForge Schema Compare for MySQL. However, if great user experience is important to you, or multiple databases synchronization at the same time is required, your option is Bytebase.

For Developers and DBAs, beside schema compare tools, SQL client is another commonly used tool. Bytebase provides SQL Editor, which not only is an alternative to SQL clients, but also ensures data security.
