As your platform engineering practice evolves, your team can begin to explore more specialized, domain-specific tools.
In this post, we will cover the advanced tools for platform engineering.

We pick ArgoCD, Snyk, Temporal, Bytebase, and Cortex as the platform engineering advanced toolkit. They are categorized based on their strategic use cases:

- **Unbundling GitHub**: ArgoCD for continuous deployment, Snyk for software supply chain security.
- **Tools designed for large teams**: Temporal for workflow orchestration, Bytebase for database development workflow, Cortex for internal development portal.

## [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) - Continuous Deployment

If your infrastructure is on Kubernetes. ArgoCD will provide a Kubernetes-native, declarative GitOps
approach to application deployment and management. It continuously monitors and syncs applications
with the desired state defined in Git repositories, offering seamless integration with Kubernetes clusters. ArgoCDâ€™s features, like easy rollbacks, multi-cluster management, and a visual UI for monitoring application health, make it well-suited for Kubernetes environments. For an enhanced ArgoCD experience, consider exploring [Akuity](https://www.akuity.io/), founded by the creator of ArgoCD.

## [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) - Software Supply Chain Security

While [GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) provides a solid foundation for platform engineering teams, it may not offer the breadth needed for more mature teams managing diverse tools and environments (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, containers, IaC).

Snyk is a dedicated security platform, offering broader coverage for dependency, container, and infrastructure security. It integrates seamlessly with a variety of platforms (GitHub in particular) and provides comprehensive security automation.

Snyk has its own dashboard and UI where you can manage security issues across various projects and repositories. It enhances collaboration between your platform engineering and security teams, providing a streamlined and efficient security experience.
