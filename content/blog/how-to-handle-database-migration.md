description: We can't avoid database schema changes, but we can make them less painful. Meeting Bytebase, a database change tool that incorporates the best practices of treating database changes like code changes and separating code changes from database changes.

I recently noticed this post in Reddit's r/golang entitled "[How do you handle migrations ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/12mypec/how_do_you_handle_migrations/)" It got 40+ replies in less than a day.

True that database schema changes have always been a headache for developers, but can't avoid because business needs to develop and products need to iterate. Adding new features often means modifying database structure, such as adding a new field to save new information, which involves database schema changes.

Let's take a look at the 2 concerns raised by the author:

**1 - Lack of visibility of changes**

The developer or the DBA may connect directly to the database and execute the change, and only the person knows what statement was executed and when it was executed (or they might just forget).

**2 - Ensuring the uniqueness and exclusivity of changes**

An app usually has multiple deployments, but all connected to the same database. From the description, it appears that the author was trying to update the database when a new version deploys. So the question is, when multiple copies of the new version are deployed at the same time, how exactly to guarantee that only one of the copies can make changes to the database while the others wait?

The author ends up asking for best practices and tools that can be used in a production environment. From a best practice perspective, there are 2 main points:

1. Treat database changes like code changes
2. Separate code changes from database changes

**Bytebase is exactly the database change tool that incorporates this set of best practices.**

## Treat your database changes the same way you treat code changes

Let's look at a typical code change CI/CD process:

1. A change request is submitted to a code repository, such as GitLab (Merge Request, MR) or GitHub (Pull Request, PR).
2. Say you've enabled some sort of CI actions, the MR / PR will first go through a series of those automated checks, for example, whether the code can be compiled or it conforms to the coding specification, followed by a series of automated tests (CI Automation).
3. One or more reviewers will review the code (Code Review).
4. Afterwards, the code is submitted to the repository and the commit history is recorded.
5. After a manual or automated process, the code is packaged into a new version, an **Artifact**, in technical term.
6. The deployment system gradually deploys the new version according to a pre-configured process. Usually it is first deployed to a test environment where integration tests are run, and possibly manual tests by the QA team. After that, it will be deployed to the pre-release/staging environment. If the verifications pass, it will eventually be deployed to the production environment. Of course, in the production environment, the new version will be gradually rolled out, which is also known as the **grayscale/canary release**.

The code CI/CD process, as we know, is not complicated, but it took more than 20 years for the industry to figure out and agree upon, which solves a series of problems such as collaboration, visibility, reliability, and efficiency in code changes and releases.

As for database changes, because it involves data change, that is, the **state**. Although the process can be borrowed from the idea of code change, it is still more complicated.

**Bytebase is such a set of tools to introduce the process of code changes to database changes.**

### Visualized Change UI

![_](/blog/how-to-handle-database-migration/change-ui.webp)

Bytebase provides a web-based GUI for developers and DBAs to collaborate on database changes.

### Automated SQL Review Policies

![_](/blog/how-to-handle-database-migration/sql-review-setup.webp)

Bytebase has 100+ SQL review rules built-in, using the shift-left approach to pre-screen change scripts submitted by developers, before DBAs intervene.

### Database as Code (GitOps)

![_](/blog/how-to-handle-database-migration/google.webp)

Bytebase is a proponent and industry leader for Database-as-Code solution. As per Google, Bytebase is ranked #1 for Database as Code, ahead of established vendors like Liquibase and DBmaestro.

![_](/blog/how-to-handle-database-migration/gitops.webp)

Bytebase is the only tool in the industry that provides a point-and-click interface to configure a GitOps workflow, similar to the Terraform Cloud / Vercel experience. Once configured, devs can submit database change scripts through their familiar code repos. The deployment process will be automatically triggered by Bytebase after the change scripts are merged into the code repo.

### Batch changes (Enterprise Plan)

Changing one database is hard enough, let alone a batch of databases at the same time. This is actually very common in enterprises. For example:

- Different environments correspond to different databases;
- SaaS companies may allocate a separate database to separate tenants;
- For gaming companies, different servers correspond to different databases.
- Due to disaster recovery or data compliance requirements, different regions may also deploy their own databases;
- Of course, let's not forget the common database sharding technique for handing massive data.

Bytebase allows you to [change a collection of databases with identical schemas](/docs/batch-change/multi-tenant-change/), as shown in the figure below: changing the database of a hospital SaaS system, for different hospital tenants in different environments, in just one sitting.

### Custom Approval Flow (Enterprise Plan)

We recently introduced [custom approval flow](/docs/administration/custom-approval) based on risk level. You first define the risk level of operations done to your databases and configure the corresponding approval flows according to the different risk levels.

The approval flow can be customized, thanks to Bytebase's [**Project**](/docs/concepts/data-model/#project) concept, meaning you can specify the approvers from a specific project.

## Separate code changes from database changes

An application has two major components: code and data, the former is **stateless** and the latter is **statefull**. Stateless changes are relatively easy to solve, because if there is a problem with the change, you can simply roll back and be done with it. But stateful changes are much more complicated: you have to consider whether it will lock the database and lead to unavailability of the whole service, plus rollback is much harder because of dirty data.

When small teams first start out, they usually put database and code changes together, but as the Reddit author encounters, when they scaled up, they faced problems:

1. When changes go wrong, there is little control. The application will not start, which requires manual intervention.
2. Some changes take a long time to complete, which means downtime when deploying new releases.
3. This approach isn't suitable for applications that have multiple server instances accessing the same database. This is because any one server instance can execute changes and additional locking mechanisms are needed to coordinate changes (the problem mentioned above)
4. This also doesn't work well for teams with a dedicated DBA or platform engineering team to centrally manage the databases. The person has no way to know when a change has occurred; they will only find out that it was caused by a reckless change after receiving a monitoring system alert and spending a lot of effort to diagnose.

Stateful data and stateless code are two different species. While there are centralized CI/CD platforms like GitLab / GitHub + Octopus / Jenkins for releasing code changes, Bytebase plays a similar role in releasing **changes to the database**.

That's why Bytebase can also be referred to as the GitLab for databases, taking on the role of Database DevOps. Like GitLab, we have adopted a similar open-source strategy, offering both a [hosted SaaS service](https://hub.bytebase.com/workspace) and [self-host](/docs/get-started/install/deploy-with-docker/) options.

## The Default Tool for Database Change Management

Bytebase aims to help DBA and developer teams from different industries to manage the change, query, security and governance of databases, on and off the cloud, across different clouds.

Just like GitLab / GitHub when it comes to code hosting, Prometheus / Grafana when it comes to monitoring, and Terraform when it comes to multi-cloud management, Bytebase wants to become the default tool for database change management.
