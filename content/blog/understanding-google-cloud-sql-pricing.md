Google Cloud SQL is a popular database service from Google Cloud. It offers completely managed relational databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server with rich extension collections, configuration flags, and developer ecosystems. Apart from features, pricing is another core factor to consider when comparing it with other similar services like AWS RDS and Microsoft Azure SQL Database. Also, there are several discussions on Reddit related to the pricing of Google Cloud SQL, as shown in the figure below. These all point to the importance of understanding the structure of Google Cloud SQL pricing.

## Google Cloud SQL Pricing

Pricing for Google Cloud SQL is based on a pay-as-you-go model. It depends on instance type including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, and consists of the following charges:

- CPU and memory pricing
- Storage and networking pricing
- Instance pricing
- SQL Server license pricing

### CPU and Memory Pricing

Pricing for CPUs and memory varies based on the following three primary factors:

- The volume of CPUs you choose
- The total memory you select
- The region where your instance is located

If you enable other services, the total cost may include those charges:

- Failover replicas pricing
- Read replicas pricing
- High Availability pricing

In addition, Cloud SQL provides committed use discounts (CUDs) that grant deeply discounted prices for continuous use of database instances in a particular region for a one-year or three-year term. CUDs only apply to CPU and memory pricing. For more information, go to review [Committed use discounts](https://cloud.google.com/sql/cud).

### Storage and Networking Pricing

Storage and networking pricing is influenced by the following elements:

- The destination of the egress traffic
- The region where your instance is located
- Whether or not High Availability(HA) is configured

### Instance Pricing

Instance pricing is only relevant for shared-core instances. It is charged for every second that the instance is running with the activation policy being set to “always”. For more details, see [Billing on partial seconds](https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing#billing-partial-seconds).

### SQL Server License Pricing

[SQL Server License Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing#sql-licensing) is based on the selected edition.SQL Server instances are charged a 10 minute minimum for licenses. After 10 minutes, SQL Server licenses are charged in 1 minute increments.

## Tools for Estimating Google Cloud SQL Pricing

Given the previous section, pricing for Google Cloud SQL is complex and varies by several elements. Fortunately, there are two tools that can help you estimate pricing easily.

- **Pricing Calculator**

[Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator) is the offical tool from Google Cloud. It enables you to estimate Google Cloud SQL cost with different configurations. After selecting the database engine, enter required information such as the number of instances, instance type, and location, and click **ADD TO ESTIMATE** to generate the result.

- **DB Cost**

[DB Cost](https://www.dbcost.com/) is an open source pricing comparison tool for Google Cloud SQL and AWS RDS. It can provide estimates of a set of instances according to your configurations, such as database engines, billed models(on demand and reserved), multiple locations, and the lease length.

What's more, DB Cost allows you to compare two selected instances in a more intuitive way, as shown the following figure.

## Tips for Optimizing Google Cloud SQL Pricing

As mentioned above, one of the biggest concerns raised by reddit discussions is how to optimize Google Cloud SQL cost. Here are some common tips collected from networks:

- Take advantage of discounts for reserved instances: Cloud SQL offers committed use discounts that give you a 25% discount off of on-demand pricing for a one-year commitment and a 52% discount for a three-year commitment.

- Delete idle instances: It is well known that idle or abandoned resources are one of the biggest sources of waste in cloud spending. To reduce your cloud cost, it is absolutely necessary to delete idle instances.

- Resize overallocated instances: Over-provisioning resources is common for DBAs who are used to provisioning larger instances on-premises. However, it can lead to unnecessary spending when migrating to the cloud platform. The smart way to optimize your cloud cost is to identify your resource requirements and scale  instances accordingly.

As you known, developers usually require multiple environments including dev, test, staging, and production environments in the database development process. To optimize cloud cost, the cost-effective solution is to migrate the production environment to Google Cloud SQL and leave the other environments on-premises or on other low-cost platforms. So you need a database tool to manage instances across multiple platform reliably and effectively, [Bytebase](https://www.bytebase.com) will be a great fit.
