The [2023 Stack Overflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/) shows that Postgres has taken
over the first place spot from MySQL and become the most admired, desired databases.

As Postgres gains more momentum, it becomes harder to pick between Postgres and MySQL. MySQL is
probably still the world's most popular open source database by install base. While Postgres positions
itself as the world's most advanced open source relational database.

At Bytebase, we work with both databases extensively since the Bytebase product needs to integrate
with both databases as well as their derivatives. Our founders also build [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql), one of the largest hosted MySQL & Postgres cloud sevices at Google Cloud SQL.

Based on our operating experience, below we give an extensivie comparision between Postgres and MySQL
from the following dimensions:

## Performance

## Features

## Security

## Extensibility

## Usability

## Architecture

## Ecosystem

## Watchout
