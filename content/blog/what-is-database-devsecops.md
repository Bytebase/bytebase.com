Last time we addressed [What is Database DevOps](/blog/what-is-database-devops/), today we are extending
the topic to **Database DevSecOps**.

**Database DevSecOps** is the practice of integrating security throughout the entire database development
lifecycle, much like how DevSecOps evolved from DevOps. Given that data security is critical,
especially in preventing breaches, it makes sense for security to be a central focus in database operations.
By embedding security measures from the start, organizations can better protect their most valuable
asset—data—while minimizing risks and ensuring compliance.

## The Security Role in Database DevSecOps

In addition to the typical Developer and DBA roles in database DevOps, Security engineer joins the party:

- **Developer** - Build and deliver ASAP.
- **DBA** - Prevent database outage.
- **Security engineer** - Prevent data breach.

By looping in the security engineers, we are also facing the classic trolley problem in the database domain.
