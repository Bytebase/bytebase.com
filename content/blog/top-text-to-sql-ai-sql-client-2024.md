If you work with databases, SQL AI tools can significantly improve your productivity and efficiency. They help generate SQL commands automatically from natural language input and optimize query performance as functional and starter-friendly tool.

Here we gathered some of the most popular SQL AI tools on the market in 2024.

## SQL Chat

[SQL Chat](https://www.sqlchat.ai/) is a chat-based SQL client, which uses natural language to communicate with the database to implement operations such as query, modification, addition, and deletion of the database. Instead of navigating across many UI controls, SQL chat applies a much more intuitive chat-based interface, bringing more flexible and comfortable user experience.

SQL Chat supports the following databases and will add more over time:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MSSQL
- TiDB Cloud

## SQLAI.ai

[SQLAI.ai](https://www.sqlai.ai/) is divided into several SQL generators, each serving specific purposes:
 
- **Explain SQL Queries**: Offers explanations with summaries, output visualizations, and detailed query breakdowns.
- **Format SQL Query**: Formats SQL queries for improved readability and reduced error-proneness.
- **Analyze Your Data**: Allows you to upload CSV data and ask AI questions.
- **Generate SQL Query, Fix SQL Queries, Optimize SQL Query, etc.**

In addition to the core generators, SQLAI.ai includes tools to facilitate your work. The available tools vary depending on the generator.

## Outerbase

[Outerbase](https://www.outerbase.com/) impresses users at first sight with its strong-sense-of-tech and comics-style interface.

You can give AI agent "EZQL" natural language prompts. Conversations are powered by OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-16k model.

## DataGrip

The JetBrains AI service of [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) employs different large language models (LLMs) and transparently makes them work for you as a product user. It is powered by OpenAI and Google as the primary third-party providers, as well as by a number of JetBrainsâ€™ proprietary models.

With a JetBrains AI service subscription, DataGrip AI Assistant is available in **IntelliJ IDEA**, **PyCharm**, **PhpStorm**, **ReSharper**, and other JetBrains IDEs, as well as in **Fleet** as a supplemental feature.

## Honorable mention: Postgres.new

Postgres.new is an in-browser PostgreSQL sandbox with AI assistance. It allows users to operate with PostgreSQL directly in a web browser, without having to install or set up the database locally.

Postgres.new is currently in early alpha with limited functionality and lacks mobile support. It may have limitations compared to a full native PostgreSQL installation.

## What We Think

SQL AI tools improve efficiency, make it easier to interact with databases. Although they also use state-of-the-art natural language processing models, the results may sometimes be inaccurate. If you want to use them in production, make sure to double-check before you hit RUN.
