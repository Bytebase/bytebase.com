Database security is a critical aspect of information technology that focuses on protecting databases from unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Access control, one of its fundamental components, involves assigning different permission levels to users based on their roles and responsibilities. In most database systems, these permissions are categorized into three main levels: Read, Write, and Admin.

## Read

**Read** is the fundamental access level that allows a user to view or retrieve data from a database without the ability to modify it. Analysts and Developers use this level to access and analyze data. It includes the following operations:

- Fetch metadata (information_schema or catalog info)
- Run EXPLAIN. This is for developer to troubleshoot problematic queries
- Run SELECT

## Write

**Write** allows a user to modify data in a database. Developers and DBAs (Database administrators) use this level to perform tasks such as data insertion, update, and deletion depending on their permissions. It includes the following operations:

- DML change (data change)
- DDL change (schema migration)

## Admin

**Admin** is the highest level of access that grants users the ability to manage database users, permissions, and system settings. DBAs use this level to perform tasks such as granting user permissions, setting database level settings, and restarting the database.

- Grant user permissions
- System change (e.g. set database level settings, restart database)

## Conclusion

Access control levels are essential for database security, ensuring data protection while enabling authorized users to perform their tasks. Instead of logging in different database engines to configure, modern platforms like [Bytebase](https://www.bytebase.com/) now offer centralized permission management across multiple database engines, improving both security and efficiency.
