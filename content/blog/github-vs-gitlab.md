Unless you are an Atlassian fanatic, your choice for source code management (SCM) will likely come
down to GitHub or GitLab. At Bytebase, we’ve extensively used both to develop our [database-as-code](/docs/vcs-integration/overview/)
solutions. Drawing from our hands-on experience, we provide a detailed comparison of GitHub and GitLab
across the following key areas.

## History

![github](/content/blog/github-vs-gitlab/github.webp)

**GitHub** was launched in [April 2008](https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/we-launched/). GitHub
quickly gained traction among developers, becoming a hub for open-source projects. In 2018, Microsoft
[acquired](https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/) GitHub for $7.5 billion.
In 2021, GitHub [introduced Copilot](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/),
revolutionizing how developers write code. Today, GitHub is the world's largest code collaboration platform,
empowering millions of developers and organizations globally.

**GitLab** was launched in October 2011 as an open-source project, aiming
to provide a self-hosted alternative to existing Git repository management solutions.

During the [YC 2015 pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmrDjvv_ENQ&t=141s), GitLab positioned itself as an
open-source GitHub alternative. In 2021, GitLab goes public on the NASDAQ under the ticker `GTLB`. Over time,
GitLab evolved from a DevOps platform to a comprehensive DevSecOps solution, integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
In May 2023, GitLab [introduced AI-powered features](https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2023-05-22-gitlab-16-announces-ai-powered-devsecops-platform/)
with the release of GitLab 16, followed by the beta release of GitLab Duo Chat in November 2023.

## Deployment Model

GitHub began as a SaaS platform and later introduced self-hosted options through GitHub Enterprise.

GitLab started as a self-hosted solution and subsequently offered a SaaS option.

Despite both platforms offering SaaS and self-hosted options, there's a perception that GitHub is primarily SaaS-focused, while GitLab is more associated with self-hosting. GitHub has enhanced its self-hosted offerings with features like CodeQL.

You can self-host GitLab Community Edition for free, whereas self-hosting GitHub requires the Enterprise version.

## Tech Stack

GitHub primarily uses Ruby on Rails for its core application, with MySQL serving as its main database.

GitLab also relies on Ruby on Rails but uses PostgreSQL as its core database. In 2018, GitLab introduced `Gitaly`,
a Git RPC service written in Go. For more details on GitLab’s tech stack, refer to the [installation requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html).

## Repository Management

The core feature sets are comparable. However, GitHub leads the way in code collaboration, pioneering lightweight forks and pull requests (PRs).

GitLab later introduced merge requests (MRs), its equivalent to GitHub's PRs, along with fork functionality.
