When looking for a database CI/CD and schema migration change tool, Flyway and Liquibase are two common options. Understanding the differences between these two tools can help potential users choose the one that best meets their needs.

## What Flyway and Liquibase have in common

- Native SQL supported, however Liquibase requires XML changelog to define the changes.
- Database CI/CD with version control system #GitOps (see [Database GitOps configuration](#database-gitops-configuration)).
- Auto SQL check (see [Auto SQL check](#sql-auto-check)).
- Schema Synchronization (see [Sync schema](#sync-schema)).
- Tiered pricing, offering both free and paid plan.
- Open source, both has long history.

  ![liquibase-logs](/content/blog/flyway-vs-liquibase/liquibase-logs.webp)

### Sync schema

- **Flyway**: Via the flyway desktop, there is a way to generate a migration script to bring the target database schema in sync with the one you already created (usually dev).
  ![flyway-sync-schema](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-flyway/flyway-sync-schema.webp)
- **Liquibase**: Support `diff-changelog` to compare databases and to create a deployable changelog to sync.

### Rollback
- **Flyway**: Write rollback scripts manually. Supported in Team version.
- **Liquibase**: Support `rollback-one-changeset` or `rollback`.

### Schema drift detection

- **Flyway**: Run `flyway check -drift ...` to produce a report indicating difference between target database and the one created by the migrations applied by Flyway.
- **Liquibase**: Run `liquibase diff --format=json` to produce a report indicating difference between target database and source database.

## Summary

Flyway and Liquibase are both popular tools for database CI/CD. Liquibase uses an XML format changelog, which makes it more flexible but also has a steeper learning curve. Flyway uses numeric ordering of SQL scripts, which is easier to learn but can lead to conflicts in collaboration.

Ultimately, the choice between Flyway and Liquibase depends on your specific needs and preferences. Both are powerful CLI tools and widely used in the industry. If you are looking for a more interactive GUI and more collaboration features, you may consider [Bytebase](/).
