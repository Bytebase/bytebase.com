  ![bb-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-issue-waiting.webp)
  ![bb-gui](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-gui.webp)

### Query

- **Metabase**: There're two methods to query data, with both allowing you to visualize results, incorporate them into dashboards, and share with others.

    1. **Question** is used to create a question with interactive blocks, which is good for non-technical users.
        ![mb-question](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-question.webp)

    1. **SQL query** is used to write SQL directly, which is efficient for technical users. Switching to Metadata allows you to inspect database tables and schemas.
        ![mb-sql-query](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-sql-query.webp)

- **Bytebase**: **SQL Editor** is used to execute queries. You can query a table either by double-clicking on a table or by manually writing SQL with the help of auto-completion.
  
  Compared with Metabase's SQL query, Bytebase's SQL Editor is more like a SQL client, making it a better fit for developers and DBAs.
  ![bb-data-query](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-data-query.webp)

### SQL snippet

- **Metabase**: SQL snippets can be saved, and users with SQL editor permissions for any connected database can create, edit, and manage (archive or unarchive) all snippets. Starting with the **Pro plan**, you may also set permissions for these snippets by organizing them into folders.
  ![mb-snippet](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-snippet.webp)

- **Bytebase**: You may save your scripts or star specific saved scripts for easy access. Starting with the **Pro plan**, you may also share the script with your team.
  ![bb-sheets](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-sheets.webp)

### Visualization

- **Metabase**: Create visualizations and dashboards from your data. You can also create derived tables, called models, that can pull together data from different tables to make your data more intuitive for your teams.
  ![mb-visualization](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-visualization.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Not available. It's more like a SQL client for developers and DBAs to query data. The only visualization is the **Schema Diagram**.
  ![bb-schema-diagram](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-schema-diagram.webp)

### Access control

- **Metabase**: `Admin` can create `Collection` to organize questions, dashboards, models, timelines, and other collections. There are three permission levels available for both collections and data sources: `Curate Access`, `View Access`, and `No Access`. These permissions can be assigned to specific `user groups`.

  ![mb-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-access-control.webp)

  With **Pro plan**, you can also set up permissions to restrict access to specific rows or columns.

  ![mb-pro-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-pro-access-control.webp)

- **Bytebase**: Roles are divided into two levels - Workspace and Project. `Workspace Admins`/`DBAs` set up database instances and manage members. `Project Owners` handle databases, issues, and members at the Project level. Individuals can hold multiple project-level roles, such as `Project Developers` (change database), and `Project Queriers` (query database).
  ![bb-access-control](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-access-control.webp)

  With **Community plan**, if one's not assigned to a project, one can't see the project at all. With **Enterprise plan**, `Project Owner` can grant access to specific databases or tables instead of all project databases to a specific `Project Querier`. `Project Developer` can also request to query or export a database or table with a request issue.
  ![bb-access-control-adv](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-access-control-adv.webp)

  Additionally, `Admins`/`DBAs` can set different data access controls for various environments, such as restricted access to production data and open access to development data.
  ![bb-ac-env](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-ac-env.webp)

### Data masking

- **Metabase**: Not available. However, access control for specific rows or columns is available with the **Pro plan**. This serves a purpose akin to data masking but is less convenient, adaptable, and secure.

- **Bytebase**: `Admins`/`DBAs`/`Project Owners` can configure data masking for specific columns within a table and can also authorize particular users to access the original, unmasked data. `Project Querier`, on the other hand, is limited to accessing only the masked data.

  Furthermore, `Admins`/`DBAs` can define semantic types for masking algorithms, such as email, phone, credit card, etc. As a result, the data will be masked according to the semantic type configured.
  ![bb-masking-graph](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-masking-graph.webp)

### Audit log

- **Metabase**: **Audit Log** is available for the **Pro** and **Enterprise plan**. It gives admin an overview of how people are interacting with their Metabase. 
  ![mb-audit-log](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/mb-audit-log.webp)

- **Bytebase**: **Audit Log** is available for the **Enterprise plan**. It records all the activities within Bytebase which can be filtered or exported.
  ![bb-audit-log](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-audit-log-dropdown.webp)

### Change

- **Metabase**: Not available.

- **Bytebase**: Every change to the database should proceed through an issue. The issue will automatically bring you **SQL Review**, **Custom Approval Flow** and other related features.
  ![bb-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-issue-waiting.webp)

  Every change will be recorded in the **Change History**. Bytebase will also detect the schema changes made by other tools and mark them as **Schema Drift**.
  ![bb-history](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-history.webp)

  If you write a SQL script such `ALTER TABLE` in **SQL Editor**, you'll either create a new issue or switch to **Admin mode** (similar to SSH in the terminal).
  ![bb-force-issue](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-force-issue.webp)
  ![bb-force-issue-preview](/content/blog/bytebase-vs-metabase/bb-force-issue-preview.webp)

  The suggested way is to choose databases in Bytebase console and with the help of **Schema Editor**, you can create a new issue with ease.
