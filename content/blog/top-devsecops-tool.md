description: DevSecOps tools empower teams to seamlessly integrate security into every phase of the software development lifecycle, fostering the adoption of DevSecOps practices.

**DevSecOps** stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It extends the principles of DevOps by embedding security practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from initial design to deployment and maintenance.

In traditional DevOps, security checks might occur at the end of the development process. DevSecOps shifts this to ["shift-left"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) security, meaning security is integrated early and continuously across the pipeline. In this post, we are taking a look at some popular DevSecOps tools.

## GitLab

GitLab began as an open-source alternative to GitHub, initially focusing on version control and collaboration for developers. Over the years, GitLab has evolved into a comprehensive DevSecOps platform, embedding security directly into the software development lifecycle.

In March 2024, GitLab further reinforced its security focus by [acquiring Oxeye](https://about.gitlab.com/press/releases/2024-03-20-gitlab-acquires-oxeye-to-advance-application-security-and-governance-capabilities), a company specializing in cloud-native application security and risk management.

## Snyk

Snyk is a developer-first security platform that focuses on integrating security into the development workflow, enabling teams to identify and remediate vulnerabilities across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). As a key player in the DevSecOps space, Snyk bridges the gap between developers and security teams by embedding automated security checks directly into coding, build, and deployment pipelines.

By providing real-time feedback within IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and repositories, Snyk's platform empowers developers to take ownership of security without disrupting their workflows.

Snyk also expands its capabilities via acquisitions. In 2024, it has acquired [Probely](https://snyk.io/news/snyk-acquires-developer-first-dast-provider-probely/) and [Helios](https://snyk.io/blog/welcoming-helios-to-snyk/).
