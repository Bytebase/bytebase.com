Database-as-a-service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing service model where a third-party provider hosts and maintains a database for customers. This allows customers to use a database without having to set up and manage the underlying infrastructure themselves.

## What benefits does a Database-as-a-Service offer

- **Database Engine**: This is the kernel of DBaaS. It can be a SQL-based relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, Redis.

- **Networking**: DBaaS provides public ip/host, private ip/host, VPN. Some providers also provide specialized solution such as AWS PrivateLink.

- **High Availability (HA)**: DBaaS provides out-of-the box HA solutions. The failover may happen automatically or be triggered manually.

- **Scalability**: DBaaS providers offer scalable solutions, allowing databases to grow in size and performance as needed, often with minimal downtime. Several venders offer serverless option that can scale up and down. GCP Cloud SQL also offers automatic disk resize when the disk space approaches limit.

- **Automated Backups and Recovery**: Regular backups are performed automatically, and tools are provided for data recovery in case of loss. Most providers also provide point-in-time-recovery (PITR).

- **Monitoring and logging**: These tools help in managing the database's performance, monitoring resource usage, logging events.

- **Optimization**: Some providers also provide query optimization insights.

- **Security**: This includes data encryption (both encryption at rest and in transit), access controls, audit logging and other security measures to protect data.

- **API and Integration**: DBaaS often provides a full suite of APIs to manages its resources. Many of them also provide
  Terraform providers. Other integrations include email, webhooks and IMs.
